    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nLos Angeles (LA), a sprawling metropolis known for its diversity and global cultural influence, has a complex history of crime that has evolved alongside the city’s rapid growth. From the early 20th century, when organized crime syndicates and Prohibition-era bootlegging plagued its streets, to the racially charged tensions and gang violence that emerged in the post-World War II period, LA’s criminal landscape has mirrored the social, economic, and demographic changes of the city.\nAt the center of this history is the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), which has faced its own challenges. The LAPD has a complex history shaped by corruption scandals, strained community relations, and efforts at reform. From the 1950s through the 1990s, LAPD leadership emphasized professional policing but often operated in isolation from democratic regulation and community relationships, particularly in marginalized areas like South LA. High-profile incidents such as the Rodney King beating in 1991 and the Rampart corruption scandal in the late 1990s exposed systemic issues within the department, prompting significant reforms aimed at fostering community policing and improving transparency by allowing the public to access real-time information. Apps such as Citizen and platforms like the USC Department of Public Safety’s Crime Alerts are key tools in this shift and have prompted this analysis.\nIn light of this backdrop, this analysis uses the LAPD’s Crime Data from 2020 to the present to explore crime incidence and distribution across LA. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of reported crimes, offering insights into trends by geographic areas, crime types, and victim demographics. Additionally, neighborhood population estimates from the Los Angeles Almanac are used for contextual analysis. These estimates, while based on U.S. Census data, are not official since the Census does not account for city-defined neighborhood boundaries. Instead, the Almanac approximates populations using a widely accepted neighborhood boundary map, providing a useful but unofficial framework for understanding crime’s impact on different communities. Hence, this analysis aims to shed light on how crime is evolving in the city and to better understand the distribution and impact of crime in different communities.\n\nPrimary Questions of Interest\n How have crime rates changed across different geographic areas in Los Angeles (LA) from 2020 to 2024, and what trends can be observed in terms of the age, sex, and descent of victims? \n\n\n\nMethods\n\nDataset Background\nThe main source of data used for this analysis was obtained from the Los Angeles Open Data Portal, specifically the “Crime Data from 2020 to Present” dataset. This dataset is maintained by the LAPD and provides comprehensive records of crime incidents reported in the city since 2020. Accessing the data involved navigating to the Public Safety section of the Los Angeles City Data Catalog where the dataset is publicly available for download. The data was exported as a CSV file, which was subsequently imported into R for further analysis and exploration. This dataset was chosen for its breadth of information, allowing for detailed analysis of crime incidence and distribution in LA, which is pertinent to understanding public safety in the area.\nIn this dataset, 986,500 observations (rows) of 28 variables (columns) capture details about crime incidents in the LA area. Each row represents an individual crime incident, and the variables include details such as the crime type, area name, and geographic coordinates, as well as key victim details such as age, sex, and descent. The dataset also includes timestamps and codes related to the modus operandi, which enable an in-depth analysis of crime patterns, regional concentrations, and demographic trends in the 2020-2024 timeframe under study.\nAdditionally, population estimates for Los Angeles neighborhoods from the Los Angeles Almanac were integrated into the analysis. These estimates provide total population counts for each neighborhood, facilitating the exploration of crime trends relative to population distributions. While derived from U.S. Census data, the estimates are approximations and not official census counts, as neighborhood boundaries are not formally defined. This combined data enables a deeper understanding of crime distribution.\n\n\nData Cleaning and Wrangling\nTo clean and prepare the crime dataset for analysis, several steps were taken to ensure the data was clear, interpretable, and ready for data analysis. Upon loading the dataset, an initial exploration was performed, which involved checking the dataset’s dimensions, inspecting the names and types of variables, and checking for any missing cases among the variables of interest. Next, I specified the variables of interest for further analysis, including DATE.OCC (date crime occurred), TIME.OCC (time crime occured), AREA (area code), AREA.NAME (area name), Vict.Age (age of victim), Vict.Sex (sex of victim), and Vict.Descent (descent of victim). I conducted a missing value analysis for these variables to ensure data integrity, with results presented in a summary table indicating no missing values among specified variables.\nSubsequent data wrangling involved converting the DATE.OCC variable to a date-time object and extracting the year, month, and day. I defined specific crime codes for violent and property crimes, creating categorical variables to classify crime types and categorized crimes with codes that were not specified in the dataset manual as “other” to account for all crimes reported. The Vict.Age variable was re-coded to indicate no victim involved when the age was zero, leading to the creation of a new variable that distinguished between cases with and without a victim. Additionally, I re-coded the descent and sex variables into clearer categories. To group areas into broader regions, I categorized the AREA.NAME variable into specific bureaus based on LAPD crime mapping.\nAs part of the data wrangling process, I established age categories to enable comparisons across distinct demographic groups. However, I recognize the potential drawbacks of converting a continuous variable (age) into a categorical one. Categorization can lead to information loss by grouping nuanced data into broader bins, reducing the granularity and variability that the original data offers. That said, age categorization may still be useful for certain types of analysis or visualization, particularly when exploring trends or patterns across predefined age groups to reflect meaningful groupings relevant to the study.\nThroughout the cleaning process, I updated the list of variables of interest, removing any variables that were irrelevant or had excessive missing values. Additionally, partial data for 2024—reflecting reports only up to mid-October—was excluded to ensure consistency. Only data from complete months through September 2024 was retained for analysis. The final dataset included the following variables of interest: crime code, year, month, day, crime category, specific crime category, region, victim involvement, victim sex, victim descent, and victim age categories. I addressed implausible values by filtering out any entries where Victim_Age was less than 0 or greater than 99. I confirmed the categorization of crimes and other attributes, noting that the missing values primarily occurred for cases where the age was recorded as zero, indicating no victim was involved.\nThe population dataset was extracted from the Los Angeles Almanac website and cleaned to focus on relevant neighborhoods and population totals. Key steps included retaining only “Neighborhood” and “Total Population” columns, removing duplicates, filtering for key neighborhoods, and mapping them to corresponding LAPD areas. The cleaned dataset was then merged with the crime dataset using shared geographic identifiers to enable analysis of population-adjusted crime trends.\nThe final dataset contained 983,675 observations and 15 variables.\n\n\nData Exploration\nTo analyze crime trends in LA from 2020 to 2024, I summarized key variables using descriptive statistics compiled into tables for clear visualization. I addressed the primary research question by displaying the total crime count for each year from 2020 to 2024, including percent change year-over-year (Table 1). Next, I focused on the geographic distribution of crimes (Table 2). I computed the total crime count for each area, allowing me to identify regions with the highest and lowest crime counts By organizing this data by region, I could visualize how crime was concentrated in specific areas and track changes over time. Lastly, I examined victim demographics. I calculated counts given the nature of the outcome variable, observing patterns in victim age group (Table 3), descent (Table 4), and sex (Table 5) to see if certain demographic groups were disproportionately affected by crimes in LA between the years 2020 and 2024.\n\n\nTable 1(a-e).

Trend of Crime Count in LA Over Time (2020-2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates monthly crime trends from 2020 to September 2024, highlighting both consistent patterns and significant anomalies. From 2020 to 2023, crime levels remained relatively stable, with predictable seasonal fluctuations throughout the year. However, 2024 stands out with a sharp and sustained decline in crime beginning in April and plateauing at significantly lower levels by June. This distinct deviation from prior years suggests the influence of an external factor or intervention that effectively reduced crime rates during 2024.\n\n\nFigure 2. Trends in Monthly Crime Rates per 100,000 Population by Region (2020-2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 highlights the monthly crime trends across four regions in Los Angeles from 2020 to 2024. In 2020, crime rates generally decline until mid-year before stabilizing, with the Valley Bureau consistently reporting the lowest rates. In 2021, crime rates show a more pronounced increase in the latter half of the year, particularly in the Central and West Bureaus, while the Valley Bureau maintains lower rates. As for 2022, the Central Bureau consistently had the highest rates, peaking around mid-year at 2,747 per 100,000 population. The South Bureau West Bureau followed similar trends, with moderate fluctuations but lower rates than the Central Bureau. The Valley Bureau had the lowest crime rates throughout the year, maintaining a steady trend with minimal changes. In 2023 Central Bureau remained the region with the highest crime rates, although its peaks were slightly lower than in 2022. The South Bureau West Bureau exhibited moderate increases during the middle of the year, followed by gradual declines. The Valley Bureau continued its stable pattern with the lowest rates and minimal variability compared to other regions. Finally, in 2024, Central Bureau West Bureau experienced sharp declines after March, dropping to a low of 933 per 100,000 population in the West Bureau and 1,078 per 100,000 populaton in Central Bureau. South Bureau also saw a steady decrease, though at a slower pace. The Valley Bureau again maintained the lowest and most stable crime rates, showcasing consistency. This figure highlights an overall downward trend in crime rates towards September, particularly in areas with previously higher rates.\n\n\nFigure 3. Monthly Crime Counts by Year and Crime Category (2020–2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 illustrates the distribution of total crimes in Los Angeles across three categories—Other, Property Crime, and Violent Crime—from 2020 to September 2024. Property crimes consistently reported the highest numbers across all years, peaking in December 2023 at 9,696 incidents. Violent crimes showed moderate fluctuations, with notable increases in mid-2022, reaching a peak of 6,165 in May, before steadily declining to extremely low levels by mid-2024, such as only 188 in June. “Other” crimes remained relatively stable, with some seasonal variations, but also experienced a significant decline by mid-2024. A clear downward trend in overall crime rates is evident starting in 2024, with property and violent crimes sharply dropping, especially violent crime, which fell dramatically to less than 200 incidents per month in the second half of 2024. This suggests an improvement in crime control measures or societal changes during this period.\n\n\nFigure 4. Crime Rates per 100,000 Population by Region and Crime Category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 shows the distribution of Property Crime, Violent Crime, and Other Crimes across four regions in Los Angeles per 100,000 population as normalized crime rates. The West Bureau stands out with the highest rate of Property Crime, exceeding 400,000, while its Violent Crime rate is also significant but slightly lower. In the South Bureau, Violent Crime is relatively high and nearly matches its Property Crime rate, emphasizing a concerning balance between these two categories. The Central Bureau displays a more even distribution among the three crime categories, with Property Crime being slightly more dominant. Meanwhile, the Valley Bureau reports the lowest overall crime rates, with Property Crime slightly exceeding Violent Crime and Other categories. Overall, the data underscores significant regional differences in crime patterns, with Property Crime being the most prevalent type across most regions.\n\n\nTable 6.

Burglary experienced the most significant decline, dropping 66.31%, while Motor Vehicle Theft decreased by a modest 16.41%. Other Theft saw a smaller reduction of 10.71%, and Theft from Vehicle declined by 35.43%. Notably, Personal Theft increased by 12.90%, marking the only category to show growth during this period. Overall, while most property crime categories have decreased, the trends suggest differing rates of reduction across specific types of crime.\n\n\nFigure 5. Monthly Crime Trends by Victim Involvement in Los Angeles (2020-2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 displays monthly trends in victimless and victim-involved crimes from 2020 to 2024. Victim-involved crimes are consistently higher than victimless crimes across all years. These crimes show slight fluctuations from 2020 to 2023 but exhibit a sharp decline starting mid-2024. Conversely, victimless crimes remain relatively stable across all years, averaging around 4,000 cases monthly with minimal variation. The data suggests a notable decrease in victim-involved crimes in 2024, likely driven by external interventions or policy changes, while victimless crimes maintain a steady pattern throughout.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIn Conclusion, from 2020 to 2024, Los Angeles saw notable shifts in crime patterns across various categories and regions, with key insights emerging from the data. Between 2020 and 2023, crime rates followed relatively stable seasonal trends, with peaks often occurring mid-year and gradual declines toward year-end. However, 2024 diverged significantly, with crime rates dropping sharply in April and stabilizing at much lower levels by mid-year, marking a substantial and unusual decline compared to previous years (Tables 1a–1e, Figure 1). This change suggests the influence of external factors such as policy interventions or broader societal shifts. The 2020 data also reflects the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which likely contributed to reduced crime rates during that period.\nCrime trends varied across regions, with the Valley Bureau recording the highest total crimes (286,724) but maintaining relatively stable rates over time, while the Central Bureau consistently showed the highest crime rates per capita. The West Bureau experienced the highest property crime rates, and the South Bureau faced a concerning balance between property and violent crimes, emphasizing regional disparities in crime dynamics (Table 2, Figure 2). Crime distribution by category revealed property crimes as the most prevalent type across all years, while violent crimes saw notable fluctuations before their dramatic decline in 2024. “Other” crimes remained stable, with only minor seasonal variations (Figures 3 and 4).\nThe analysis of victim demographics revealed that young adults aged 20–39 were disproportionately affected, representing over 50% of total crime victims. Older adults and seniors faced lower victimization rates, with numbers decreasing significantly for those aged 80 and above (Table 3). In terms of descent, Hispanic/Latino/Mexican individuals accounted for the largest share of victims (39.77%), followed by White (25.26%) and Black (18.34%) victims, while smaller ethnic groups experienced notably fewer incidents (Table 4). The data also showed a near-equal distribution of victimization by sex, with males slightly more affected (50.33%) than females (48.26%), while the “Other” category accounted for 1.39% of victims (Table 5).\nCrime categories showed substantial reductions over the five-year period, particularly for violent crimes, where all major categories—aggravated assault, homicide, rape, robbery, and simple assault—declined by 66–80% (Table 7). Among property crimes, burglary saw the largest reduction (-66.31%), while motor vehicle theft and theft from vehicles also dropped notably. However, personal theft increased slightly by 12.9%, standing out as the only category to show growth during this period (Table 8). Victim-involved crimes remained significantly higher than victimless crimes through 2023 but exhibited a sharp decline in 2024, while victimless crimes remained stable, averaging around 4,000 incidents per month across all years (Figure 5).\nOverall, the data underscores significant progress in reducing crime in Los Angeles, particularly in 2024, when rates fell to historically low levels compared to simiar months between 2020 and 2023. However, the incomplete data for 2024 requires cautious interpretation, as the year is not yet over, and the full context of contributing factors remains unclear. Regional disparities and differences in crime types persist, with some areas and demographics facing disproportionate impacts. These findings emphasize the need for sustained and targeted interventions to address ongoing challenges and ensure equitable reductions in crime across all regions and populations.\nThe observed trends in crime rates across Los Angeles from 2020 to 2024 can be attributed to various interrelated factors. Economic conditions play a significant role; the peak in crime during 2022 likely correlated with financial instability resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, while the subsequent decline in 2024 may reflect economic recovery and improved employment opportunities. Additionally, community policing initiatives and enhanced law enforcement strategies aimed at fostering trust between police and residents may have effectively deterred criminal activity. The availability of social services, such as youth engagement programs and mental health support, can also mitigate factors contributing to crime, particularly in vulnerable populations. Furthermore, demographic shifts, particularly among Hispanic/Latino/Mexican communities, highlight the importance of addressing specific social dynamics that impact crime victimization. Overall, these complex factors underscore the necessity of targeted, data-driven approaches to crime prevention that address both the symptoms and root causes of crime in Los Angeles.\n\nFuture Consderations\nAs crime trends in Los Angeles continue to evolve, several pertinent questions arise that warrant further exploration. One critical area is the impact of socioeconomic status on crime victimization and perpetration, particularly among different demographic groups. Investigating how factors such as income level, education, and employment status intersect with age, sex, and descent could yield valuable insights into the underlying causes of crime. Additionally, it would be worthwhile to examine the effectiveness of specific community policing strategies across diverse neighborhoods and how these initiatives influence crime rates and community trust in law enforcement.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCity of Los Angeles Neighborhoods Population & Race.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nLos Angeles (LA), a sprawling metropolis known for its diversity and global cultural influence, has a complex history of crime that has evolved alongside the city’s rapid growth. From the early 20th century, when organized crime syndicates and Prohibition-era bootlegging plagued its streets, to the racially charged tensions and gang violence that emerged in the post-World War II period, LA’s criminal landscape has mirrored the social, economic, and demographic changes of the city.\nAt the center of this history is the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), which has faced its own challenges. The LAPD has a complex history shaped by corruption scandals, strained community relations, and efforts at reform. From the 1950s through the 1990s, LAPD leadership emphasized professional policing but often operated in isolation from democratic regulation and community relationships, particularly in marginalized areas like South LA. High-profile incidents such as the Rodney King beating in 1991 and the Rampart corruption scandal in the late 1990s exposed systemic issues within the department, prompting significant reforms aimed at fostering community policing and improving transparency by allowing the public to access real-time information. Apps such as Citizen and platforms like the USC Department of Public Safety’s Crime Alerts are key tools in this shift and have prompted this analysis.\nIn light of this backdrop, this analysis uses the LAPD’s Crime Data from 2020 to the present to explore crime incidence and distribution across LA. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of reported crimes, offering insights into trends by geographic areas, crime types, and victim demographics. Additionally, neighborhood population estimates from the Los Angeles Almanac are used for contextual analysis. These estimates, while based on U.S. Census data, are not official since the Census does not account for city-defined neighborhood boundaries. Instead, the Almanac approximates populations using a widely accepted neighborhood boundary map, providing a useful but unofficial framework for understanding crime’s impact on different communities. Hence, this analysis aims to shed light on how crime is evolving in the city and to better understand the distribution and impact of crime in different communities.\n\nPrimary Questions of Interest\n How have crime rates changed across different geographic areas in Los Angeles (LA) from 2020 to 2024, and what trends can be observed in terms of the age, sex, and descent of victims? \n\n\n\nMethods\n\nDataset Background\nThe main source of data used for this analysis was obtained from the Los Angeles Open Data Portal, specifically the “Crime Data from 2020 to Present” dataset. This dataset is maintained by the LAPD and provides comprehensive records of crime incidents reported in the city since 2020. Accessing the data involved navigating to the Public Safety section of the Los Angeles City Data Catalog where the dataset is publicly available for download. The data was exported as a CSV file, which was subsequently imported into R for further analysis and exploration. This dataset was chosen for its breadth of information, allowing for detailed analysis of crime incidence and distribution in LA, which is pertinent to understanding public safety in the area.\nIn this dataset, 986,500 observations (rows) of 28 variables (columns) capture details about crime incidents in the LA area. Each row represents an individual crime incident, and the variables include details such as the crime type, area name, and geographic coordinates, as well as key victim details such as age, sex, and descent. The dataset also includes timestamps and codes related to the modus operandi, which enable an in-depth analysis of crime patterns, regional concentrations, and demographic trends in the 2020-2024 timeframe under study.\nAdditionally, population estimates for Los Angeles neighborhoods from the Los Angeles Almanac were integrated into the analysis. These estimates provide total population counts for each neighborhood, facilitating the exploration of crime trends relative to population distributions. While derived from U.S. Census data, the estimates are approximations and not official census counts, as neighborhood boundaries are not formally defined. This combined data enables a deeper understanding of crime distribution.\n\n\nData Cleaning and Wrangling\nTo clean and prepare the crime dataset for analysis, several steps were taken to ensure the data was clear, interpretable, and ready for data analysis. Upon loading the dataset, an initial exploration was performed, which involved checking the dataset’s dimensions, inspecting the names and types of variables, and checking for any missing cases among the variables of interest. Next, I specified the variables of interest for further analysis, including DATE.OCC (date crime occurred), TIME.OCC (time crime occured), AREA (area code), AREA.NAME (area name), Vict.Age (age of victim), Vict.Sex (sex of victim), and Vict.Descent (descent of victim). I conducted a missing value analysis for these variables to ensure data integrity, with results presented in a summary table indicating no missing values among specified variables.\nSubsequent data wrangling involved converting the DATE.OCC variable to a date-time object and extracting the year, month, and day. I defined specific crime codes for violent and property crimes, creating categorical variables to classify crime types and categorized crimes with codes that were not specified in the dataset manual as “other” to account for all crimes reported. The Vict.Age variable was re-coded to indicate no victim involved when the age was zero, leading to the creation of a new variable that distinguished between cases with and without a victim. Additionally, I re-coded the descent and sex variables into clearer categories. To group areas into broader regions, I categorized the AREA.NAME variable into specific bureaus based on LAPD crime mapping.\nAs part of the data wrangling process, I established age categories to enable comparisons across distinct demographic groups. However, I recognize the potential drawbacks of converting a continuous variable (age) into a categorical one. Categorization can lead to information loss by grouping nuanced data into broader bins, reducing the granularity and variability that the original data offers. That said, age categorization may still be useful for certain types of analysis or visualization, particularly when exploring trends or patterns across predefined age groups to reflect meaningful groupings relevant to the study.\nThroughout the cleaning process, I updated the list of variables of interest, removing any variables that were irrelevant or had excessive missing values. Additionally, partial data for 2024—reflecting reports only up to mid-October—was excluded to ensure consistency. Only data from complete months through September 2024 was retained for analysis. The final dataset included the following variables of interest: crime code, year, month, day, crime category, specific crime category, region, victim involvement, victim sex, victim descent, and victim age categories. I addressed implausible values by filtering out any entries where Victim_Age was less than 0 or greater than 99. I confirmed the categorization of crimes and other attributes, noting that the missing values primarily occurred for cases where the age was recorded as zero, indicating no victim was involved.\nThe population dataset was extracted from the Los Angeles Almanac website and cleaned to focus on relevant neighborhoods and population totals. Key steps included retaining only “Neighborhood” and “Total Population” columns, removing duplicates, filtering for key neighborhoods, and mapping them to corresponding LAPD areas. The cleaned dataset was then merged with the crime dataset using shared geographic identifiers to enable analysis of population-adjusted crime trends.\nThe final dataset contained 983,675 observations and 15 variables.\n\n\nData Exploration\nTo analyze crime trends in LA from 2020 to 2024, I summarized key variables using descriptive statistics compiled into tables for clear visualization. I addressed the primary research question by displaying the total crime count for each year from 2020 to 2024, including percent change year-over-year (Table 1). Next, I focused on the geographic distribution of crimes (Table 2). I computed the total crime count for each area, allowing me to identify regions with the highest and lowest crime counts By organizing this data by region, I could visualize how crime was concentrated in specific areas and track changes over time. Lastly, I examined victim demographics. I calculated counts given the nature of the outcome variable, observing patterns in victim age group (Table 3), descent (Table 4), and sex (Table 5) to see if certain demographic groups were disproportionately affected by crimes in LA between the years 2020 and 2024.\n\n\nTable 1(a-e).

Trend of Crime Count in LA Over Time (2020-2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates monthly crime trends from 2020 to September 2024, highlighting both consistent patterns and significant anomalies. From 2020 to 2023, crime levels remained relatively stable, with predictable seasonal fluctuations throughout the year. However, 2024 stands out with a sharp and sustained decline in crime beginning in April and plateauing at significantly lower levels by June. This distinct deviation from prior years suggests the influence of an external factor or intervention that effectively reduced crime rates during 2024.\n\n\nFigure 2. Trends in Monthly Crime Rates per 100,000 Population by Region (2020-2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 highlights the monthly crime trends across four regions in Los Angeles from 2020 to 2024. In 2020, crime rates generally decline until mid-year before stabilizing, with the Valley Bureau consistently reporting the lowest rates. In 2021, crime rates show a more pronounced increase in the latter half of the year, particularly in the Central and West Bureaus, while the Valley Bureau maintains lower rates. As for 2022, the Central Bureau consistently had the highest rates, peaking around mid-year at 2,747 per 100,000 population. The South Bureau West Bureau followed similar trends, with moderate fluctuations but lower rates than the Central Bureau. The Valley Bureau had the lowest crime rates throughout the year, maintaining a steady trend with minimal changes. In 2023 Central Bureau remained the region with the highest crime rates, although its peaks were slightly lower than in 2022. The South Bureau West Bureau exhibited moderate increases during the middle of the year, followed by gradual declines. The Valley Bureau continued its stable pattern with the lowest rates and minimal variability compared to other regions. Finally, in 2024, Central Bureau West Bureau experienced sharp declines after March, dropping to a low of 933 per 100,000 population in the West Bureau and 1,078 per 100,000 populaton in Central Bureau. South Bureau also saw a steady decrease, though at a slower pace. The Valley Bureau again maintained the lowest and most stable crime rates, showcasing consistency. This figure highlights an overall downward trend in crime rates towards September, particularly in areas with previously higher rates.\n\n\nFigure 3. Monthly Crime Counts by Year and Crime Category (2020–2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 illustrates the distribution of total crimes in Los Angeles across three categories—Other, Property Crime, and Violent Crime—from 2020 to September 2024. Property crimes consistently reported the highest numbers across all years, peaking in December 2023 at 9,696 incidents. Violent crimes showed moderate fluctuations, with notable increases in mid-2022, reaching a peak of 6,165 in May, before steadily declining to extremely low levels by mid-2024, such as only 188 in June. “Other” crimes remained relatively stable, with some seasonal variations, but also experienced a significant decline by mid-2024. A clear downward trend in overall crime rates is evident starting in 2024, with property and violent crimes sharply dropping, especially violent crime, which fell dramatically to less than 200 incidents per month in the second half of 2024. This suggests an improvement in crime control measures or societal changes during this period.\n\n\nFigure 4. Crime Rates per 100,000 Population by Region and Crime Category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 shows the distribution of Property Crime, Violent Crime, and Other Crimes across four regions in Los Angeles per 100,000 population as normalized crime rates. The West Bureau stands out with the highest rate of Property Crime, exceeding 400,000, while its Violent Crime rate is also significant but slightly lower. In the South Bureau, Violent Crime is relatively high and nearly matches its Property Crime rate, emphasizing a concerning balance between these two categories. The Central Bureau displays a more even distribution among the three crime categories, with Property Crime being slightly more dominant. Meanwhile, the Valley Bureau reports the lowest overall crime rates, with Property Crime slightly exceeding Violent Crime and Other categories. Overall, the data underscores significant regional differences in crime patterns, with Property Crime being the most prevalent type across most regions.\n\n\nTable 6.

This table shows that North Hollywood has the highest raw crime count (50,036), followed by Van Nuys (41,931) and West Valley (41,351). Other areas, such as Devonshire (40,874), Topanga (40,487), Mission (39,466), and Foothill (32,579), also contribute significantly to the overall crime in the region.\n\n\nTable 7.

Aggravated Assault decreased by 70.14%, and Homicides saw the steepest drop of 73.88%. Similarly, Rape incidents declined by 79.41%, the largest percentage reduction among all categories. Robbery cases decreased by 66.32%, while Simple Assaults fell by 69.70%. These trends indicate a significant reduction in violent crime over the five-year period, with 2024 showing markedly lower numbers compared to prior years.\n\n\nTable 8.

Burglary experienced the most significant decline, dropping 66.31%, while Motor Vehicle Theft decreased by a modest 16.41%. Other Theft saw a smaller reduction of 10.71%, and Theft from Vehicle declined by 35.43%. Notably, Personal Theft increased by 12.90%, marking the only category to show growth during this period. Overall, while most property crime categories have decreased, the trends suggest differing rates of reduction across specific types of crime.\n\n\nFigure 5. Monthly Crime Trends by Victim Involvement in Los Angeles (2020-2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 displays monthly trends in victimless and victim-involved crimes from 2020 to 2024. Victim-involved crimes are consistently higher than victimless crimes across all years. These crimes show slight fluctuations from 2020 to 2023 but exhibit a sharp decline starting mid-2024. Conversely, victimless crimes remain relatively stable across all years, averaging around 4,000 cases monthly with minimal variation. The data suggests a notable decrease in victim-involved crimes in 2024, likely driven by external interventions or policy changes, while victimless crimes maintain a steady pattern throughout.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIn Conclusion, from 2020 to 2024, Los Angeles saw notable shifts in crime patterns across various categories and regions, with key insights emerging from the data. Between 2020 and 2023, crime rates followed relatively stable seasonal trends, with peaks often occurring mid-year and gradual declines toward year-end. However, 2024 diverged significantly, with crime rates dropping sharply in April and stabilizing at much lower levels by mid-year, marking a substantial and unusual decline compared to previous years (Tables 1a–1e, Figure 1). This change suggests the influence of external factors such as policy interventions or broader societal shifts. The 2020 data also reflects the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which likely contributed to reduced crime rates during that period.\nCrime trends varied across regions, with the Valley Bureau recording the highest total crimes (286,724) but maintaining relatively stable rates over time, while the Central Bureau consistently showed the highest crime rates per capita. The West Bureau experienced the highest property crime rates, and the South Bureau faced a concerning balance between property and violent crimes, emphasizing regional disparities in crime dynamics (Table 2, Figure 2). Crime distribution by category revealed property crimes as the most prevalent type across all years, while violent crimes saw notable fluctuations before their dramatic decline in 2024. “Other” crimes remained stable, with only minor seasonal variations (Figures 3 and 4).\nThe analysis of victim demographics revealed that young adults aged 20–39 were disproportionately affected, representing over 50% of total crime victims. Older adults and seniors faced lower victimization rates, with numbers decreasing significantly for those aged 80 and above (Table 3). In terms of descent, Hispanic/Latino/Mexican individuals accounted for the largest share of victims (39.77%), followed by White (25.26%) and Black (18.34%) victims, while smaller ethnic groups experienced notably fewer incidents (Table 4). The data also showed a near-equal distribution of victimization by sex, with males slightly more affected (50.33%) than females (48.26%), while the “Other” category accounted for 1.39% of victims (Table 5).\nCrime categories showed substantial reductions over the five-year period, particularly for violent crimes, where all major categories—aggravated assault, homicide, rape, robbery, and simple assault—declined by 66–80% (Table 7). Among property crimes, burglary saw the largest reduction (-66.31%), while motor vehicle theft and theft from vehicles also dropped notably. However, personal theft increased slightly by 12.9%, standing out as the only category to show growth during this period (Table 8). Victim-involved crimes remained significantly higher than victimless crimes through 2023 but exhibited a sharp decline in 2024, while victimless crimes remained stable, averaging around 4,000 incidents per month across all years (Figure 5).\nOverall, the data underscores significant progress in reducing crime in Los Angeles, particularly in 2024, when rates fell to historically low levels compared to simiar months between 2020 and 2023. However, the incomplete data for 2024 requires cautious interpretation, as the year is not yet over, and the full context of contributing factors remains unclear. Regional disparities and differences in crime types persist, with some areas and demographics facing disproportionate impacts. These findings emphasize the need for sustained and targeted interventions to address ongoing challenges and ensure equitable reductions in crime across all regions and populations.\nThe observed trends in crime rates across Los Angeles from 2020 to 2024 can be attributed to various interrelated factors. Economic conditions play a significant role; the peak in crime during 2022 likely correlated with financial instability resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, while the subsequent decline in 2024 may reflect economic recovery and improved employment opportunities. Additionally, community policing initiatives and enhanced law enforcement strategies aimed at fostering trust between police and residents may have effectively deterred criminal activity. The availability of social services, such as youth engagement programs and mental health support, can also mitigate factors contributing to crime, particularly in vulnerable populations. Furthermore, demographic shifts, particularly among Hispanic/Latino/Mexican communities, highlight the importance of addressing specific social dynamics that impact crime victimization. Overall, these complex factors underscore the necessity of targeted, data-driven approaches to crime prevention that address both the symptoms and root causes of crime in Los Angeles.\n\nFuture Consderations\nAs crime trends in Los Angeles continue to evolve, several pertinent questions arise that warrant further exploration. One critical area is the impact of socioeconomic status on crime victimization and perpetration, particularly among different demographic groups. Investigating how factors such as income level, education, and employment status intersect with age, sex, and descent could yield valuable insights into the underlying causes of crime. Additionally, it would be worthwhile to examine the effectiveness of specific community policing strategies across diverse neighborhoods and how these initiatives influence crime rates and community trust in law enforcement.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCity of Los Angeles Neighborhoods Population & Race.

Title: An Exploration of Trends in Crime Rates Across Los Angeles (2020-2024)

Description: This project analyzes crime trends in Los Angeles from 2020 to 2024 using LAPD crime data and neighborhood population estimates. By exploring geographic crime distribution and demographic patterns of victims, it aims to understand shifts in crime rates across the city. The analysis examines changes in crime incidence, with a focus on trends related to victim age, sex, and descent, and investigates how these patterns reflect broader social and economic dynamics in LA’s diverse communities.

Instructions to access the dataset: The primary dataset, [‘Crime Data from 2020 to Present,’](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8/about_data) was obtained from the Los Angeles Open Data Portal. A secondary [Los Angeles neighborhoods' population estimates](https://www.laalmanac.com/population/po24la.php#google_vignette) dataset was obtained from the Los Angeles Almanac.

The downloaded dataset is available in the "Data" folder in this repository.
